## Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Testing student endpoints while logged in as staff
**Error:** 403 Forbidden - "User is not a student"
**Fix:** Login as student first using `Login (Student)`

### ‚ùå Testing staff endpoints while logged in as student
**Error:** 403 Forbidden - "Unauthorized"
**Fix:** Login as staff first using `Login (Staff)`

### ‚ùå Using old token
**Error:** 401 Unauthorized - "Missing JWT"
**Fix:** Login again to get a fresh token

## Pro Tips

1. **Always check which user you're logged in as**
   - Use `Identify Current User` endpoint
   - Returns your username and ID

2. **Token expires after 15 minutes**
   - Just login again if you get 401 errors

3. **Each login overwrites the previous token**
   - If you login as staff, you're no longer logged in as student
   - Need to switch? Just login as the other role again
